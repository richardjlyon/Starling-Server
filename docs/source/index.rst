Bank Server
=========================================

**Bank Server** is a Python library that provides a server for interacting with your bank accounts.

Native bank web apps are often limited. Every service provider's API is different. Online budget services are `self-defeatingly over-priced <https://www.youneedabudget.com/price-change-2021/>`_. Wouldn't it be nice to have a server that provided a standardised way of accessing your accounts
held at different financial providers, and analysis tools you need to understand your finances?

That's what *Bank Server* does.
